I have started each ftp server one by one and then start ftp connection and upload and download 1GB file from server.

for CPU usage : "top" command OR "ps -p <pid> -o %cpu,%mem,cmd" command

And noticed time from ftp response.

For,

    vsftpd_v4 version CPU usage for Upload of 1GB file : 99-100%
    vsftpd_v4 version CPU usage for Upload of 1GB file : 99-100%

Here download time CPU usage is 2X or more than QBox_benchmark.
